            <p>"Medical Laboratory Technolgy (MLT) are vital to the healthcare team as they are often
                the first to produce patient results. MLTs use sophisticated biomedical instrumentation,
                as well as manual procedures, to perform testing and provide results that are essential in
                the diagnosis, prevention of disease.
                It is estimated that over 70% of all medical decisions are based in part on laboratory results.</p>
            <p>The Medical Laboratory Technology has  multi-level functions in the areas of collecting,
                processing, and analyzing biological specimens and other substances, principles and methodologies,
               principles and practices of quality assessment for all major areas: clinical chemistry,
                hematology, microbiology, and molecular biology practiced in the
                contemporary clinical laboratory."</p>
